# 4R3 Y0U 4 H4XX0R?

## What's this?
This is the rewrite of [SBHS Timetable](https://github.com/sbhs-forkbombers/sbhs-timetable) for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), designed to be faster and more efficient.

## What happened to feature _xyz_?
If it directly relates to the timetable/belltimes functionality here, and can be implemented with the [current APIs available](https://student.sbhs.net.au/help/api), it will hopefully be back soon. However, if it isn't part of the timetable, it might not come back, for example, the homework management feature.

## Can you do feature _abc_?
If it can be done with the [current APIs available](https://student.sbhs.net.au/help/api), then tell us about it. Either open an issue here (if you know how to do that), join us on IRC (`##sbhstimetable` on freenode ([webchat](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23%23sbhstimetable))), or fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1z7uAIRsPjDTQxevO1R5GFn4OrETeHuZ0j2jzBcg3UKM/viewform).

## Help! It doesn't work!
Again, you should tell us about this. Open an issue, fill out the feedback form, or join us on IRC.
