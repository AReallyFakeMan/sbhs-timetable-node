# Hi there!
Congratulations — you've reached SBHStimetable.tk v2.0!
## What's new?
1. **Security**  — Now you don't have do type in your timetable - or even give us your identity. All we get is a single token that allows us to retrieve data on your behalf and display it to you.
We can't store or log your data, so only you and the people sitting behind you can see it.
2. **Simplicity** — It's been rewritten from the ground up using the same engine as Google Chrome, to be faster, smaller and more efficient.
3. **Real-time updates** — Got a room change? Or maybe a substitute? It'll show up here!

All these good things, and if you're curious about how your data is handled, or want to contribute, you can take a look at the code which can be found [here](https://github.com/sbhs-forkbombers/sbhs-timetable-node).

##I'm logged out, but it still remembers my timetable?
That's normal. It also remembers the daily notices — if you want to make it forget you can either clear the local storage data in your browser or click [here](#).
