	Congratulations - you've reached SBHSTimetable.tk v2.0!<br /><br />
	<h2>What's new?</h2>
	<hr />
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Security</strong> &mdash; Now you don't have to type in your timetable - or even give us your identity. All we get is a single token that allows us to retrieve data on your behalf and display it to you.<br />We can't store or log your data, so only you and the people sitting behind you can see it.</li>
		<li><strong>Simplicity</strong> &mdash; It's been rewritten from the ground up using the same engine as Google Chrome, to be faster, smaller and more efficient.</li>
		<li><strong>Real-time updates</strong> &mdash; Got a room change? Or maybe a casual? It'll show up here (we make no claims as to the reliability of this information. <strong>Check your student portal or the room your class is timetabled at for more solid information</strong>)</li>
	</ol>
	All these good things, and if you're curious about how your data is handled, or want to contribute, you can take a look at the code which can be found <a href="https://github.com/sbhs-forkbombers/sbhs-timetable-node">here</a>.<br /><br />
	<h2>I'm logged out, but it still remembers my timetable?</h2>
	That's normal. If you want to make it forget this you can either clear the local storage data in your browser or click
	<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="clearLocalStorage()">here</a>.<span style="position: absolute; right: 0; text-align: right; font-size: 1.5em" id="removed"></span>
	</body>
