	<h1 style="font-weight: 100; font-size: 3em">Isn't this snazzy?</h1>
	Congratulations - you've reached SBHSTimetable.tk v2.0!<br /><br />
	<h2>What's new?</h2>
	<hr />
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Security</strong> &mdash; Now you don't have to type in your timetable - or even give us your identity. All we get is a single token that allows us to retrieve data on your behalf and display it to you.<br />We can't store or log your data, so only you and the people sitting behind you can see it.</li>
		<li><strong>Simplicity</strong> &mdash; It's been rewritten from the ground up using the same engine as Google Chrome, to be faster, smaller and more efficient.</li>
		<li><strong>Real-time updates</strong> &mdash; Got a room change? Or maybe a casual? It'll show up here (we make no claims as to the reliability of this information. <strong>Check your student portal or the room your class is timetabled at for more solid information</strong>)</li>
	</ol>
	All these good things, and if you're curious about how your data is handled, or want to contribute, you can take a look at the code which can be found <a href="https://github.com/sbhs-forkbombers/sbhs-timetable-node">here</a><br /><br />
	<h2>What about feature <em>x</em>?</h2>
	<hr />
	Hopefully, that'll be back soon. We're aiming for mostly-equal features before we move this to <a href="http://sbhstimetable.tk">sbhstimetable.tk</a>, but until then you'll be able to find a live, in development version of the code accessible here, with your old-fashioned version at the front page.
